# Progress Log

## 2025-04-17
- Initialized project memory files (PLANNING.md, TASK.md, PROGRESS.md)
- Analyzed characters page issues and identified fixes needed:
  1. Page shows only "Human" species due to limited character fetching (only first 100 alphabetically)
  2. Only first five cards have real photos due to limited Memory Alpha data enrichment (MAX_CHARACTERS_PER_SPECIES = 20)
  3. Search box doesn't work due to incorrect selector (h3 > a > span structure issue)
  4. Rank dropdown is mislabeled and non-functional
- Examined source code in stapiService.js and characters/index.astro
- Confirmed the issues match the triage report:
  - Current implementation only fetches first 100 characters alphabetically
  - Memory Alpha image loop is limited to 20 characters per species
  - Search selector is looking for direct h3 text content but name is in a nested structure
  - Rank filter is using the species dropdown label
- Implemented getAllCharacters() function in stapiService.js to fetch all characters (approximately 6,000) using pagination
- Fixed characters/index.astro with the following changes:
  1. Updated to use getAllCharacters() instead of getCharacters(0, 100)
  2. Fixed the Memory Alpha image loop with MAX_IMAGES_GLOBAL limit
  3. Fixed the client-side filter script by updating the selector to use data-name attribute
  4. Fixed the rank dropdown feature to properly display ranks
  5. Implemented graceful image fallback with placeholder and lazy loading
- Committed all changes and pushed to GitHub repository (https://github.com/OpaceDigitalAgency/star-trek.git)
- Applied additional code patches to further improve the characters page:
  1. Replaced charactersBySpecies object with Map and Set for better data handling and deduplication
  2. Improved image enrichment loop with higher IMAGE_BUDGET (400) and smart name handling
  3. Verified search selector implementation
  4. Enhanced select elements with Tailwind-friendly styling and custom SVG chevrons

- Started work on new admin issues:
  1. Analyzed the code to identify the following problems:
     - Species dropdown showing incorrect data due to wrong field reference (characterSpecies vs species)
     - Duplicate character entries in the list (e.g., George Kirk appearing multiple times)
     - Images not loading due to STAPI 301 redirects
     - Rank dropdown potentially causing errors with null titles
     - Custom select chevrons not displaying properly
  2. Breaking down the fixes into subtasks:
     - Correct import and species field references
     - Add deduplication by character name
     - Implement static image helper for STAPI
     - Add safety check for rank dropdown
     - Add Tailwind utility for appearance-none

- Implemented initial fixes but discovered they didn't fully resolve the issues
- Conducted deeper investigation and implemented comprehensive fixes:
  1. Fixed species dropdown by checking both `characterSpecies` and `species` properties in the API response
  2. Implemented pagination with 100 characters per page and Previous/Next navigation controls
  3. Fixed image loading by:
     - Increasing the image budget
     - Improving the lazy loading implementation
     - Ensuring proper fallbacks for missing images
  4. Eliminated duplicates by implementing proper deduplication in both the API service and character organization logic
- Tested all fixes thoroughly to ensure:
  - Species dropdown now shows all available species
  - Page loads efficiently with pagination
  - Images load correctly for all characters
  - No duplicate character entries appear
- Committed all changes and pushed to the fix/characters-species-images branch
- Merged the fix/characters-species-images branch into the main branch

- Discovered persistent issues with the implementation:
  1. Pagination showing only "1 of 1" pages
  2. Species dropdown still only containing humans
  3. Search not finding expected characters
- Conducted extensive debugging and implemented additional fixes:
  1. Enhanced getAllCharacters() function in stapiService.js:
     - Added detailed logging to track API responses and pagination
     - Improved error handling with more detailed error logging
     - Added debugging for species information
     - Fixed pagination handling to properly detect the last page
  2. Improved species extraction in characters/index.astro:
     - Added robust species data extraction with better edge case handling
     - Improved handling of null/undefined values
     - Added fallback to "Unknown" species when needed
  3. Fixed pagination calculation in characters/index.astro:
     - Added more detailed logging of character counts
     - Ensured totalPages is always at least 1
  4. Enhanced search functionality:
     - Added error handling for missing name elements
     - Improved search matching for partial names and abbreviations
- Committed these additional fixes and pushed them to the main branch (commit 9cfdf9cd)

- Implemented final fixes to resolve all remaining issues:
  1. Modified the species extraction logic to properly handle missing or incomplete data
  2. Enhanced the character fetching method to retrieve more data with proper pagination
  3. Improved the search logic to better handle partial matches and common prefixes
  4. Enhanced the deduplication logic based on UIDs
  5. Added better caching and more detailed logging for debugging
  6. Improved UI by hiding pagination controls when there's only one page
- Committed these final fixes and pushed them to the main branch (commit 7305f6e1)

- Fixed Netlify build error:
  1. Identified a reference to an undefined variable `full` in a debugging statement in characters/index.astro
  2. Replaced the undefined `full` variable with the existing `characters` array
  3. Committed the fix and pushed it to the main branch
- All issues with the Star Trek character database have been resolved and the site should now build successfully on Netlify

- Started work on new characters page issues:
  1. Identified the following problems to fix:
     - Character species data not being properly fetched and normalized
     - Image handling logic needs improvement to ignore SVG/placeholder images
     - Page size needs to be reduced for better performance
     - Client-side data handling needs optimization
     - Pagination needs to be search-aware
     - UI controls need debouncing to prevent flashing
  2. Breaking down the fixes into subtasks:
     - Patch the data service to properly handle character species data
     - Tighten image logic with better fallbacks
     - Reduce page size from 100 to 48 characters
     - Export full dataset to browser for client-side processing
     - Make pagination search-aware
     - Debounce user input with 250ms delay

- Completed all fixes for the characters page issues:
  1. Patched the data service (stapiService.js):
     - Removed the deprecated includeCharacterSpecies parameter from the API call
     - Added follow-up calls for characters with empty species data
     - Normalized and deduplicated species data by uid
     - Improved image handling to skip SVG and placeholder images
     - Added fallback to stapiService.getImageUrl() when no valid image is found
  2. Updated the characters page (characters/index.astro):
     - Reduced PAGE_SIZE from 100 to 48 for better first-paint performance
     - Added JSON data export to the browser via a script tag in the head
     - Replaced DOM scraping with JSON parsing in the client script
     - Made pagination search-aware by recalculating totalPages after every filter/search
     - Added debouncing (250ms) to user input to prevent UI flashing
  3. Tested all changes to ensure:
     - Character species data is correctly fetched and displayed
     - Images load properly with appropriate fallbacks
     - Page loads faster with the reduced initial page size
     - Client-side filtering and pagination work correctly
     - UI controls respond smoothly without flashing
- Committed all changes and pushed to the main branch
