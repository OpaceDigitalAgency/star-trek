# Progress Log

## 2025-04-17
- Initialized project memory files (PLANNING.md, TASK.md, PROGRESS.md)
- Analyzed characters page issues and identified fixes needed:
  1. Page shows only "Human" species due to limited character fetching (only first 100 alphabetically)
  2. Only first five cards have real photos due to limited Memory Alpha data enrichment (MAX_CHARACTERS_PER_SPECIES = 20)
  3. Search box doesn't work due to incorrect selector (h3 > a > span structure issue)
  4. Rank dropdown is mislabeled and non-functional
- Examined source code in stapiService.js and characters/index.astro
- Confirmed the issues match the triage report:
  - Current implementation only fetches first 100 characters alphabetically
  - Memory Alpha image loop is limited to 20 characters per species
  - Search selector is looking for direct h3 text content but name is in a nested structure
  - Rank filter is using the species dropdown label
- Implemented getAllCharacters() function in stapiService.js to fetch all characters (approximately 6,000) using pagination
- Fixed characters/index.astro with the following changes:
  1. Updated to use getAllCharacters() instead of getCharacters(0, 100)
  2. Fixed the Memory Alpha image loop with MAX_IMAGES_GLOBAL limit
  3. Fixed the client-side filter script by updating the selector to use data-name attribute
  4. Fixed the rank dropdown feature to properly display ranks
  5. Implemented graceful image fallback with placeholder and lazy loading
- Committed all changes and pushed to GitHub repository (https://github.com/OpaceDigitalAgency/star-trek.git)
- Applied additional code patches to further improve the characters page:
  1. Replaced charactersBySpecies object with Map and Set for better data handling and deduplication
  2. Improved image enrichment loop with higher IMAGE_BUDGET (400) and smart name handling
  3. Verified search selector implementation
  4. Enhanced select elements with Tailwind-friendly styling and custom SVG chevrons
